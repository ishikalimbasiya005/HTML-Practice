# Important Notes for HTML Media and Files

- Make sure the paths to your local files (images, videos, audio) are correct.
- Attributes like `hspace` and `vspace` in `<img>` are **deprecated** in HTML5; use CSS `margin` or `padding` instead.
- The `loop` attribute in `<video>` and `<audio>` does **not** take a number value like `"2"` â€” it just loops indefinitely when present.
- The `autoplay` attribute might be blocked by browsers unless the media is muted.
