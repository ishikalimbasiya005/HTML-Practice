# HTML Anchor Tag Example

This is a basic HTML example demonstrating the use of an **anchor (`<a>`) tag** with the `target` attribute.

## Description

- The webpage has a greenish background using an `rgba` color.
- It contains an `<h1>` heading with a clickable link.
- The anchor tag opens a local HTML file in a **new tab** (`target="_blank"`).
- The link text is: **CLICK NOW! My Anthor File..**

## Important Notes

- The link points to a local file path:  
  `file:///C:/ishika/CLASSES/HTML/pre%20&%20hr%20tag.html`  
  This will only work on your local machine where this file exists.
- The anchor tag attributes used:  
  - `href` – URL or path of the file to open  
  - `target="_blank"` – Opens the link in a new tab/window  

## Usage

To try this example, open the HTML file in your browser and click the link. It will open the specified local file in a new tab.
